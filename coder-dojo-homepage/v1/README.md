# CoderDojo Homepage V1

## Goals

- Get all text content and image content on screen in the correct order
- Use semantic html tags (p, section, header, footer, form, etc)

## Hold for later

- Add classnames to elements
- Add background colours to sections with CSS
- Size images better with CSS
- Add margins between sections with CSS
- Using divs/container classes to center content and impose max width on centred content.
- Using flex/grid to place grouped elements side by side
- Make the coderdojo and raspberry pi logos links
- Add embedded video with placeholder image
- Add some Javascript to the site (on the form, on the login button)
- Get everyone's attempts hosted on a subdir of the repo's GitHub page
