# CoderDojo Homepage V2

## Goals

- Using flex/grid to place grouped elements side by side
- Make the coderdojo and raspberry pi logos links
- Add embedded video with placeholder image

## Hold for later

- Add some Javascript to the site (on the form, on the login button)
- Get everyone's attempts hosted on a subdir of the repo's GitHub page
