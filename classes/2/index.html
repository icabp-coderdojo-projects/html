		<h1>Birds with Hands</h1>

			For a long time now, birds have <strong>had arms</strong>. Scientists have hid it from us for a long time, I believe.
		</p>

		<h2>Why are the scientists hiding this from us?</h2>
		<blockquote>
			"If people found out that birds had arms, that would make people feel very unsafe, as people think birds can't open doors, because they don't have hands, but, in fact, they do."
